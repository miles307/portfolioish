          <strong>Cal Poly Space Systems Avionics</strong> <em>(Sept 2024 - Present)</em>
          <p>
            I am currently developing an electronic system and test vehicle to support a booster recovery project. The system will support Ardupilot, GPS, RC control, and onboard FPV Cameras. The flight computer I selected features an STM32. I previously supported hardware development to meet requirements for new projects. I previously designed, assembled, soldered, and tested telemetry hardware for competition rockets.

          <strong>Factory Information Technology Intern</strong> <em>(Jun 2021 - Aug 2024)</em>
          <p>
            I resolved over 100 technical issues on client sites through effective collaboration with in-office staff. I also took ownership of recycling more than 1000 laptops and workstations, where I prioritized client security by ensuring the complete erasure of data from storage hardware. My work with the finance and accounting department involved establishing secure storage solutions for their sensitive information. Furthermore, I managed the detailed tracking of hardware assets throughout the recycling process, maintaining thorough documentation. My commitment extended to implementing environmentally responsible recycling practices aimed at minimizing the impact of disposed materials.

          <p>
            As a six-year member of the Jackson Hole Composite mountain bike team, I actively encouraged teammates to challenge themselves by competing in higher categories, a strategic approach that contributed to increased team points. I played a vital role in cultivating a culture of success among all team members, fostering an environment that directly contributed to the team achieving a podium finish as a Division 1 Idaho mountain bike team. Furthermore, I served as a positive role model for younger members, consistently encouraging high performance and exemplary sportsmanship both on and off the bike. My long-term commitment and influence were integral to the team's achievements and positive atmosphere within Jackson Hole Composite.

          <strong>Teton County Search and Rescue Venture Crew</strong> <em>(May 2023 - Jun 2024)</em>
          <p>
            I led avalanche and other critical backcountry training sessions, taking initiative to ensure over 50 members not only understood but actively adhered to best practices and crucial safety protocols, fostering a culture of preparedness and responsibility within the team.
            I actively participated in organization-wide meetings, demonstrating a commitment to the broader mission and proactively gaining valuable insights into the dynamics and strategies of high-performing teams and effective organizational structures.
