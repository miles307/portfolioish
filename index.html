                    <strong>Factory Information Technology Intern</strong> <em>(Jun 2021 - Aug 2024)</em>
                    <p>
                        I resolved over 100 technical issues on client sites through effective collaboration with in-office staff. I also took ownership of recycling more than 1000 laptops and workstations, where I prioritized client security by ensuring the complete erasure of data from storage hardware. My work with the finance and accounting department involved establishing secure storage solutions for their sensitive information. Furthermore, I managed the detailed tracking of hardware assets throughout the recycling process, maintaining thorough documentation. My commitment extended to implementing environmentally responsible recycling practices aimed at minimizing the impact of disposed materials.

                    <p>
                        As a six-year member of the Jackson Hole Composite mountain bike team, I actively encouraged teammates to challenge themselves by competing in higher categories, a strategic approach that contributed to increased team points. I played a vital role in cultivating a culture of success among all team members, fostering an environment that directly contributed to the team achieving a podium finish as a Division 1 Idaho mountain bike team. Furthermore, I served as a positive role model for younger members, consistently encouraging high performance and exemplary sportsmanship both on and off the bike. My long-term commitment and influence were integral to the team's achievements and positive atmosphere within Jackson Hole Composite.
