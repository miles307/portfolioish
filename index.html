      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Electrical Engineering student at Cal Poly SLO. I am interested in aerospace, nuclear energy, and sustainable transportation. I possess a unique blend of outdoor leadership and critical problem-solving skills honed through extensive backcountry skiing and dedicated volunteer service with Teton County Search and Rescue. I also compete in mountain and road cycling at the collegiate level as a valued member of the Cal Poly Club Cycling Team, demonstrating my commitment, discipline, and time-management skills.

          <strong>Cal Poly Space Systems Avionics</strong> <em>(Sept 2024 - Present)</em>
          <p>
            I am currently developing an electronic system and test vehicle to support a booster recovery project. The system supports ArduPilot, GPS, RC control, and onboard FPV cameras. The flight computer I selected features an STM32. Previously, I supported hardware development to meet requirements for new projects and designed, assembled, soldered, and tested telemetry hardware for competition rockets.

          <strong>Factory Information Technology Intern</strong> <em>(Jun 2021 - Aug 2024)</em>
          <p>
            I resolved over 100 technical issues on client sites through effective collaboration with in-office staff. I also took ownership of recycling more than 1,000 laptops and workstations, prioritizing client security by ensuring the complete erasure of data from storage hardware. My work with the finance and accounting department involved establishing secure storage solutions for their sensitive information. Furthermore, I managed detailed tracking of hardware assets throughout the recycling process, maintaining thorough documentation, and implemented environmentally responsible recycling practices to minimize the impact of disposed materials.

          <strong>Jackson Hole Composite Mountain Biking Captain</strong> <em>(Jun 2023 - Oct 2023)</em>
          <p>
            As a six-year member of the Jackson Hole Composite mountain bike team, I encouraged teammates to challenge themselves by competing in higher categories, a strategy that contributed to increased team points. I helped cultivate a culture of success among all team members, directly supporting the team’s podium finish as a Division 1 Idaho mountain bike team. I also served as a positive role model for younger members, consistently encouraging high performance and exemplary sportsmanship both on and off the bike.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Teton County Search and Rescue Venture Crew</strong> <em>(May 2023 - Jun 2024)</em>
          <p>
            I led avalanche and other critical backcountry training sessions, taking the initiative to ensure that over 50 members not only understood but actively adhered to best practices and crucial safety protocols, fostering a culture of preparedness and responsibility within the team. I also participated in organization-wide meetings, demonstrating commitment to the broader mission and gaining valuable insights into the dynamics and strategies of high-performing teams and effective organizational structures.
